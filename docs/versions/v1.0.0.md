# v1.0.0: Stable Release

**Status:** Planned

## Overview

Production-ready release with stable API.

## Criteria for 1.0

- [ ] All major features implemented (v0.1.0 - v0.7.0)
- [ ] API stability - no breaking changes expected
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Test coverage > 90%
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Security audit completed

## What "Stable" Means

After v1.0.0:
- **MAJOR** version bumps (2.0, 3.0) indicate breaking changes
- **MINOR** version bumps (1.1, 1.2) add features, backwards compatible
- **PATCH** version bumps (1.0.1, 1.0.2) are bug fixes only

Users can depend on the API not changing unexpectedly.
